# Rice PhD Thesis Template

A tuned template adapted from a [PhD thesis template](https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/21746) (view on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/rice-university-thesis-template/dsnxwrjdbrzd)) following [PhD thesis format guideline](https://graduate.rice.edu/academics/candidacy-defense-thesis-submission/thesisformat). 

The changes include:

- Set the margin to be the same on both the left and the right side and centered all contents, for better reading of the PDF file.
  - This might need to be tuned again to generate a file for printing.
- Adjusted line space to 1.5 for main text and 1.0 for biblography, to make the document more compact.
- Broke chapters to single `.tex` files in `/chapters`
- Removed unnecessary files.

This template works on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). This repository is a backup in case the one on overleaf is lost.
